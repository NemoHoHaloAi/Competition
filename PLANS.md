# PLANS

All I did in last two years:
- form `2017-10-25` to `2018-10-18`, 1 year, I done the ML class and ML+ class.
- from `2018-10-19` to `2019-11-05`, 1 year, I only done 3 projects(Titanic, House-Price, DigitReconize), starting 2 projects(ASHRA, Future-Sales-Predict) in kaggle.

In one and half years ago, I writed this:

> **Get a job about machine learning whatever how much job-pay is!!!**<br>
>> I am 26 old now, I have nothing by myself to proud. The house? my parent pay it, the job? it just so-so. I am even not better than my father on his 26 old, and I have University degree. So what I do in shenzhen from 2015 year until now. Everyone I know is working hard but me, I feel shame on myself. But good news is I still have time to find and learn how to be better. Someone will say I just follow the wind of machine learning, but I dont give a shit, it will be difficult, and job-pay will be lesser, but I will get it and do it well, I will show everyone I can do this well. Of cause first I must to finish the udacity machine learning lesson.
    
And now, I am 27, still do nothing, I am scare now, maybe this is a wrong way and I am not a hard-work person, maybe I should always be a software-engineer not a MLer, but I want to try last time, from now to `2020-05-01`, I will study harder and harder, follow my plan(kaggle projects, kaggle kernels, books and videos), I will give up if I can not get a ML job between `2020-03` and `2020-04`, please be harder and dont make yourself regretting, when you feel tired, you look around your friends(xing, qi, rui), everybody work hard and get something except for you, you should work harder than them.

## TARGET

Get a job about `Time-Series`, `Sale-Predict` and `Machine Learning`.

## Timetable

    1. deathline: `2019-11-10`;
    2. now: fix and update with [the good kernel](https://www.kaggle.com/dlarionov/feature-engineering-xgboost);
    3. and: model stack, correct factor;
2. learn how to work with time series with TS kernels
    1. deathline: `2019-11-17`;
    2. now: start with https://www.kaggle.com/shivamb/data-science-glossary-on-kaggle ;
    3. first(common): https://www.kaggle.com/thebrownviking20/everything-you-can-do-with-a-time-series ;
    4. second(ARIMA): https://www.kaggle.com/myonin/bitcoin-price-prediction-by-arima ;
    5. last(): waiting for makesure ;

    1. deathline: `2019-11-13`;
    2. target: can throw into the introduction;
4. summary of time-series kernels(Time-Series projects)

4. update introduction with some project, and add detail in project
    1. deathline: `2019-11-30`;
    2. target: can give it to the interviewers and show my Time-Series skills;
